## Overview

In this FrontendMentor challenge i have developed a responsive nft card. It has been made following the specifications requested for the challenge and using HTML and SASS

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

For the creation of this component I made an opacity change in the image to apply the effect when we hover the mouse over it, I applied flexbox in the price section and for the first time I used SASS for the css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
